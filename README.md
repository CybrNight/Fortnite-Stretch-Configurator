# FortniteStretch
This is a simple Python program that will set your Fortnite config located at C:\Users\\(user)\AppData\Local\FortniteGame\Saved\Config\WindowsClient\ to the resolution of your choosing, and handle launching the game.

# **Usage**
This uses a venv environment to eliminate the need to install Python on your machine.
Just run run.bat to use the program

NOTE:You must choose to use FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe for the executable. There are issues with BattleEye when running FortniteLauncher.exe

This is Windows only and I do not have a Mac to fix and Mac related differences if any. If someone wants to update this with Mac support they are free to do as they please.

# **TODO**
1. Update program to grab both the config and executable from registry or something
2. Clean UI
3. Profit...
