# Fortnite Stretch Configurator
This is a tool designed to make runnning Fortnite in stretched resolution simple and easily reversible without dealing with manually editing ini files and the like.

# **Usage**
This uses a venv environment to eliminate the need to install Python on your machine.
Just run run.bat to use the program

NOTE:You must choose to use FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe for the executable. There are issues with BattleEye when running FortniteLauncher.exe

This is Windows only and I do not have a Mac to fix and Mac related differences if any. If someone wants to update this with Mac support they are free to do as they please.

# TODO
1. Update program to grab both the config and executable from registry or something
2. Clean UI
3. Possibly build Windows executable wiith py2app or similar library
4. Profit...
