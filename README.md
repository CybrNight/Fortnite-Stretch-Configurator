# FortniteStretch
This is a simple Python program that will set your Fortnite config located at C:\Users\\(user)\AppData\Local\FortniteGame\Saved\Config\WindowsClient\ to the resolution of your choosing, and handle launching the game.

# **Usage**
This uses a venv environment to eliminate the need to install Python on your machine.
Just run stretchconfig.bat to start

This is Windows only and I do not have a Mac to fix and Mac related differences if any. If someone wants to update this with Mac support they are free to do as they please.
